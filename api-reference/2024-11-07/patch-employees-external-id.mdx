title: 'Update Employee'
openapi: 'PATCH /employees/{external_id}'
---

Submit the most up-to-date Employee information to update their profile inside the system. Any field that is present will overwrite existing values within the system, while absent fields will be left as-is.

Since the Employee resume is deleted after creating a skill profile, it is a required field for recalculating the skill profile based on the resume. If no resume is provided, the skill profile will be recalculated based on the other available properties.

Passing the `null` value removes non-required attributes. Object attributes will be removed when passing `null`, arrays with `[]` and strings with the empty string `''`.
