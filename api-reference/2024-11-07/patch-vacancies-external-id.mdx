title: 'Update Vacancy'
openapi: 'PATCH /vacancies/{external_id}'
---

Submit the most up-to-date Vacancy information to update their profile inside the system. Any field that is present will overwrite existing values within the system, while absent fields will be left as-is.
Passing the `null` value removes non-required attributes. Object attributes will be removed when passing `null`, arrays with `[]` and strings with the empty string `''`.
