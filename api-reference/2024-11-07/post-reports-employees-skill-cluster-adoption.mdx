Retrieve the Skill Cluster adoption report for all Employees with respect to the value of a custom property and one
or more Skill Clusters.

The report consists of three smaller reports. A heatmap, a Skill Cluster adoption report, and a skill breakdown.

- The heatmap returns the adoption of each requested Skill Cluster for all employees which have the same custom
property.
- The Skill Cluster adoption gives the proficiency level per requested Skill Cluster for each employee.
- The skill breakdown returns an overview of the skills of the requested Skill Cluster for each employee.
