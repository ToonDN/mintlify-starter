Remove an External Company from the system. The External Company's linked Vacancies will be processed in cascade based on:
  * linked __active__ Vacancy: the reference to the External Company is
removed, but the Vacancy itself is not removed from the system.
  * linked __inactive__ Vacancy: the reference to the External Company as
well as the Vacancy itself is removed from the system.
